EXAMPLE_CINEMATIC_INSPIRATIONAL_BRAND_STORY = """
Generate a 60-second cinematic inspirational video titled 'The Ascent.' For a brand focused on personal growth, resilience, and achieving potential. Aspect ratio: 16:9.

**Overall Tone:** Powerful, emotive, and uplifting.
**Target Audience:** Individuals seeking motivation, self-improvement enthusiasts.

**Narrative Arc & Key Visuals:**
1.  **(0-10s) The Challenge:** Open with a breathtaking wide drone shot of a lone climber, gender-neutral, silhouetted against a dramatic, snow-capped mountain peak at dawn. Light is golden but stark. Music: low, atmospheric, slightly tense. SFX: wind howling softly.
2.  **(10-30s) The Struggle & Perseverance:** Quick, dynamic cuts showing diverse individuals facing personal challenges with determination:
    * A student intensely studying late at night, surrounded by books, occasionally rubbing tired eyes but then refocusing. (Close-up on determined eyes).
    * An artist in a messy studio, looking frustrated at a canvas, then taking a deep breath and picking up a brush with renewed vigor. (Close-up on hands gripping brush).
    * An athlete pushing their limits during a grueling workout (e.g., running uphill, lifting weights), sweat visible, showing strain but not defeat. (Slow-motion of a single drop of sweat).
    Music builds gradually in intensity and hope.
3.  **(30-50s) Breakthrough & Small Victories:** Transition to moments of achievement and progress:
    * The student smiling, understanding dawning on their face.
    * The artist adding a confident stroke to the canvas, a small smile forming.
    * The athlete reaching the top of the hill, looking out with satisfaction.
    Music becomes more melodic and uplifting.
4.  **(50-60s) Triumph & Brand Message:** Culminate with a montage of these individuals (and others) celebrating their successes, intercut with the climber reaching the mountain summit, arms raised against a now bright and expansive sky. Text overlay (elegant font): "Reach Your Peak." Brand logo subtly appears. Music swells to a powerful, inspiring crescendo. SFX: celebratory cheers (muted), final whoosh of wind on summit.

**Visual Style:**
* Style: High-quality, cinematic realism with a slightly desaturated look in 'struggle' scenes, becoming more vibrant in 'triumph' scenes.
* Color Palette: Begins with cool blues and grays during struggle, transitioning to warm oranges, golds, and bright whites as success is achieved.
* Lighting: Dramatic and evocative, utilizing natural light (dawn, bright daylight) and shadows to enhance mood.
* Camera: Mix of sweeping drone shots, intimate close-ups on faces and hands, dynamic tracking shots. Use of slow-motion for key emotional beats.

**Auditory Elements:**
* Music: Powerful, orchestral, and emotionally resonant score that builds from tense and atmospheric to overwhelmingly inspirational.
* Sound Effects: Realistic environmental sounds (wind, footsteps, breathing, subtle sounds of effort), culminating in uplifting ambient sounds.
* Voiceover (Optional - if used, a deep, resonant, inspiring male voice): "The path is challenging. The climb, demanding. But within you lies the strength to ascend. To overcome. To reach your peak." (If no VO, music and visuals carry the narrative).
