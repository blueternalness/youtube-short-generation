EXAMPLE_ANIMATED_PRODUCT_EXPLAINER_ECO_FRIENDLY_SMART_HOME_DEVICE = """
Create a 45-second, upbeat 2D animated explainer video for 'EcoSense,' a new eco-friendly smart home device. Aspect ratio: 16:9.

**Overall Tone:** Optimistic, informative, and modern.
**Target Audience:** Environmentally conscious homeowners, tech-savvy individuals.

**Scene Breakdown & Key Visuals:**
1.  **(0-5s) Intro:** Serene animation of a modern, sunlit home interior. Text overlay: "Simplify Your Life. Sustain Our Planet." Gentle, positive music begins.
2.  **(5-15s) Problem:** Subtle animations depicting energy waste: a forgotten light glowing brightly in an empty room, an animated graph showing high energy consumption. Voiceover (friendly female): "Tired of energy bills and environmental worries?"
3.  **(15-30s) Solution - Introduce EcoSense:** Sleek, minimalist 'EcoSense' device animates into view. Show its key features via clean iconography and animated UI elements:
    * Energy Monitoring: Animated data flowing to a smartphone app interface.
    * Automated Climate Control: Thermostat icon adjusting, creating a comfortable home visual.
    * Water Leak Detection: Stylized water drop icon with an alert.
    Voiceover: "Introducing EcoSense, the smart way to manage your home efficiently."
4.  **(30-40s) Benefits:** Happy, relaxed animated characters interacting with the device, enjoying a comfortable, efficient home. Visuals of lower energy bills (animated graph trending down) and green leaf icons. Voiceover: "Save money, reduce your footprint, and enjoy peace of mind."
5.  **(40-45s) Call to Action:** End screen with 'EcoSense' logo, website URL (www.ecosensehome.example.com), and a clear "Learn More" button animation. Music swells slightly.

**Visual Style:**
* Animation: Clean, minimalist 2D flat animation with smooth transitions.
* Color Palette: Primarily greens, blues, and whites, with subtle warm accents (e.g., soft yellow for sunlight).
* Imagery: Stylized icons for features, simplified human figures with positive expressions.

**Auditory Elements:**
* Music: Upbeat, optimistic, and slightly futuristic instrumental background music. Should be non-intrusive.
* Sound Effects: Gentle chimes for notifications, subtle clicks for UI interactions, a soft 'whoosh' for data flow animations.
* Voiceover: Clear, friendly, and reassuring female voice (placeholder for now, will add actual VO post-generation)."
