I want to create short form video content with infants whose skin has the texture of fruit or food. 
In the video, a human hand (appearing giant in perspective) should be feeding the baby a spoonful of fruit or food. 
The baby has a joyful, open-mouthed expression, seemingly eager to eat.
The video should not include unrealistic scenes and unrealistic scene transitions.
Give me top 5 prompts with detailed scenarios for creating such video content. The scenario should be performed in 5 seconds.
The scenarios should include different types of foods or fruits, and unique backgrounds or settings to make each video visually appealing.

For each scenario, write prompts in the following JSON format:

{
    "scenario1" : {
        "Subject": [Detailed object description including type of fruit baby, food, clothing, color, size, and any unique features.],
        "Action": [Specific actions, behaviors, movements, sequence, interaction patterns that can be performed in 5 seconds.],
        "Scene": [Detailed environment description including location, props, background elements, lighting setup, weather, time of day, architectural details. No unrealistic scene transitions.],
        "Style": [Camera shot type, angle, movement, lighting style, visual aesthetic, color palette, depth of field, focus techniques.],
        "Sounds": [Specific audio elements including ambient sounds, effects, background audio, music, environmental noise, equipment sounds, natural acoustics],
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": No hallucinations, No unrealistic scenes, and No unrealistic scene transitions.
    },
}
