I want to create short form video content with babies performing a specific action.
The situation in video should not be boring.
The video should not include unrealistic scene transitions.
Give me top 5 prompts with detailed scenarios for creating such video content. The scenario should be performed in 5 seconds.
The scenarios should include different types of actions, various clothing items, various situations, and unique backgrounds or settings to make each video visually appealing.

For each scenario, write prompts in the following JSON format:

{
    "scenario1" : {
        "Subject": [Detailed object description including type of baby, age, situation, actions, behaviors, clothing, color, size, and any unique features.],
