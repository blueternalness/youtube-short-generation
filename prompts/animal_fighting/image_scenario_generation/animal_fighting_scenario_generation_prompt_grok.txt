I want to create provocative clickbait images where animals are fighting each other or animals are fighting with humans.
The image doesn’t have to be realistic. It can be exaggerated.
However, the human or animals in the image should look like real.

Give me 5 prompts with detailed scenarios for creating such images.

For each scenario, write prompts in the following JSON format:

{
    "scenario1" : {
        "Subject": [Detailed character/object description with several specific physical attributes, clothing, age, build, facial features, ethnicity, hair, eyes, posture, mannerisms, emotional state],
        "Action": [Specific actions, movements, gestures, behaviors, timing, sequence, transitions, micro-expressions, body language, interaction patterns],
        "Scene": [Detailed environment description including location, props, background elements, lighting setup, weather, time of day, architectural details],
        "Style": 9:16 vertical aspect ratio.
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": No hallucinations, No captions, No comic book characters.
    },
}
