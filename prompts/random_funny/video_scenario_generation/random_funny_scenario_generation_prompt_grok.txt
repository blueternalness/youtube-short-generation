I want to create short form funny, ridiculous, ludicrous clickbait video content.
Give me 5 prompts with detailed scenarios for creating such video content.

For each scenario, write prompts in the following JSON format:

{
    "scenario1" : {
        "Subject": [Detailed character/object description with several specific physical attributes, clothing, age, build, facial features, ethnicity, hair, eyes, posture, mannerisms, emotional state],
        "Action": [Specific actions, movements, gestures, behaviors, timing, sequence, transitions, micro-expressions, body language, interaction patterns],
        "Scene": [Detailed environment description including location, props, background elements, lighting setup, weather, time of day, architectural details],
        "Style": [Camera shot type, angle, movement, lighting style, visual aesthetic, aspect ratio, film grade, color palette, depth of field, focus techniques],
        "Sounds": [Specific audio elements including ambient sounds, effects, background audio, music, environmental noise, equipment sounds, natural acoustics],
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": No hallucinations, and No unrealistic scene transitions.
    },
}
