I want to generate images where various standing animals are dancing.
The animals should act like a professional dancer.
Give me top 5 prompts with detailed scenarios for creating such images.
The scenarios should include different types of adorable animals, various dances, and unique backgrounds or settings to make each video visually appealing.

For each scenario, write prompts in the following JSON format:

{
    "scenario1" : {
        "Subject": [Detailed object description including type of animal and dance.],
        "Action": [Specific actions, behaviors, movements, sequence, interaction patterns.],
        "Style": "9:16 vertical aspect ratio. a low-resolution, grainy photo taken with a cheap camera, blurry, with JPEG compression artifacts.”
    },
}
