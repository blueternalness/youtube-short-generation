I want to create short form video content where various adorable standing animals are dacing like a K-pop star.
The animals should act like a K-pop dancer while dacing.
The video should not be boring.
Give me top 5 prompts with detailed scenarios for creating such video content.
The scenarios should include different types of adorable animals, various dances, and unique backgrounds or settings to make each video visually appealing.

For each scenario, write prompts in the following JSON format:

{

        "Subject": [Detailed object description including type of animal, dance, color, size, and any unique features.],
        "Action": [Specific eating actions, behaviors, movements, sequence, interaction patterns.],
