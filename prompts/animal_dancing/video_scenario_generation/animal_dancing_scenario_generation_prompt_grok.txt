I want to create short form video contents where various standing animals are dancing.
The animals should act like a professional dancer.
The situation in the video doesn’t have to be realistic. It can be exaggerated.
However, the animal in the vieo should look like real.

Give me top 5 prompts with detailed scenarios for creating such video content.
The scenarios should include different types of animals, various dances, and unique backgrounds or settings to make each video visually appealing.

For each scenario, write prompts in the following JSON format:

{
    "scenario1" : {
        "Subject": [Detailed object description including type of animal, dance, color, size, and any unique features.],
        "Action": [Specific eating actions, behaviors, movements, sequence, interaction patterns.],
        "Style": "a low-resolution, grainy photo taken with a cheap camera, blurry, with JPEG compression artifacts.”
    },
}
