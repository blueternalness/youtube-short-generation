I want to create funny, ludicrous, provocative clickbait image where a incredibly obese human is performing various activities.
The situation in the image doesn’t have to be realistic. It can be exaggerated.
However, the human in the image should look like real.

Give me 5 prompts with detailed scenarios for creating such images.

For each scenario, write prompts in the following JSON format:

{
    "scenario1" : {
        "Subject": [Detailed character/object description with several specific physical attributes, clothing, age, build, facial features, ethnicity, hair, eyes, posture, mannerisms, emotional state],
        "Action": [Specific actions, movements, gestures, behaviors, timing, sequence, transitions, micro-expressions, body language, interaction patterns],
        "Scene": [Detailed environment description including location, props, background elements, lighting setup, weather, time of day, architectural details],
        "Style": "9:16 vertical aspect ratio. a low-resolution, grainy photo taken with a cheap camera, blurry, with JPEG compression artifacts.”
        "TechnicalDetails": "No hallucinations, No captions."
    },
}
