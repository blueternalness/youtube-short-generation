    "MiddleScene": "The friction from the downhill sprint proves too much for the tiny plastic wheels! They melt and disintegrate in a spectacular shower of sparks and smoke. The man is now skidding wildly on the metal axles, fighting a losing battle for control as he hurtles towards a busy intersection, his face a mask of sheer terror!",
    "FinalScene": "Total wipeout! The man is launched from the smoking remains of the tricycle and lands rear-first in a decorative sidewalk planter. He's dazed, tangled in a rosebush, with his helmet knock-eyed. He's still gripping the tiny pink handlebars, but the rest of the trike is a melted puddle on the asphalt. A crowd of tourists is taking photos, stunned by the spectacle."
