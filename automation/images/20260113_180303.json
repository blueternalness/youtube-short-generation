    "MiddleScene": "With the tiny wheels screaming and a thick cloud of smoke trailing behind, the man is now hurtling down the steepest part of the hill! Sparks fly wildly from his boots and the pedals as the plastic tricycle warps and threatens to disintegrate under his weight. His face is a mask of pure terror and adrenaline as he desperately tries to steer the careening toy!",
    "FinalScene": "The pink tricycle finally gives out, exploding into a shower of plastic shards! The man is sent tumbling in a spectacular, rolling crash across the asphalt, his helmet and suit a blur. Bystanders gasp as he comes to a stop in a heap of neon spandex, smoke, and broken toy parts at the bottom of the hill!"
