    "scenario1": {
        "Subject": "A translucent, ruby-red jelly strawberry with realistic golden seeds. It has a glossy, reflective surface and a soft, jiggly texture that suggests a high-viscosity silicone material.",
        "Action": "A sharp stainless steel chef's knife slowly presses into the top of the strawberry. The fruit resists slightly, bulging before the blade glides through in a single, smooth 4-second downward stroke. The two halves fall away to reveal a perfectly smooth, glass-like interior.",
        "Scene": "A minimalist light-oak cutting board placed under warm, bright studio lights. The background is a soft-focus modern kitchen with subtle hints of indoor plants.",
        "Style": "Extreme close-up (macro), 9:16 vertical ratio. High frame rate for a slight slow-motion effect. Warm color palette with high saturation on the red fruit. Shallow depth of field to blur the background.",
        "Sounds": "A satisfying 'squish' followed by a clean, wet 'shing' sound as the blade passes through. Ends with a soft 'thud' of the halves hitting the wood.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No 16:9 horizontal aspect ratio, No silent moments, and No unrealistic scene transitions."
    },
    "scenario2": {
        "Subject": "A frosted-glass pineapple with a metallic gold crown. The body has a rough, geometric texture mimicking scales, made of a brittle, crystalline resin.",
        "Action": "A heavy cleaver chops the pineapple into thick rings. Each chop takes 1 second. The blade creates small, sparkling shards that scatter across the surface as it cuts through the 'brittle' material.",
        "Scene": "A sleek black marble countertop. Overhead spotlighting creates high-contrast shadows and emphasizes the crystalline reflections of the fruit.",
        "Style": "Top-down (flat lay) angle, 9:16 vertical ratio. Sharp focus on the point of impact. Cold, cinematic color palette with high contrast.",
        "Sounds": "Sharp, rhythmic 'clinking' and 'cracking' sounds like ice breaking. The heavy 'clack' of the cleaver hitting the marble base.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No 16:9 horizontal aspect ratio, No silent moments, and No unrealistic scene transitions."
    },
    "scenario3": {
        "Subject": "A neon-green resin watermelon with a vibrant pink, glowing core. The exterior has a matte finish with dark green stripes, while the inside appears to be filled with a thick, glowing liquid.",
        "Action": "A serrated bread knife saws through the middle. The sawing motion creates a rhythmic vibration. As the knife reaches the center, a small amount of neon pink 'juice' (thick syrup) oozes out.",
        "Scene": "A futuristic, cyberpunk-themed dark room. The only light source comes from the watermelon itself and a blue LED strip in the background.",
        "Style": "Macro side-view, 9:16 vertical ratio. High saturation. Use of 'bokeh' effect for background lights. Focus remains on the glowing interior of the cut.",
        "Sounds": "A gritty, rhythmic 'grating' sound from the serrated blade, followed by a thick, bubbly 'squelch' as the liquid core is breached.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No 16:9 horizontal aspect ratio, No silent moments, and No unrealistic scene transitions."
    },
    "scenario4": {
        "Subject": "A set of three hyper-realistic wax bananas. The skin is a pale yellow with slight brown spotting (bruising) for realism, but the material is a soft, carveable paraffin wax.",
        "Action": "A small paring knife performs 'crinkle cuts'—small, jagged slices. The knife moves rapidly, popping off small coin-sized segments of the banana every 0.5 seconds.",
        "Scene": "A rustic wooden farmhouse table during 'golden hour.' Natural sunlight streams in from the side, highlighting the texture of the wax shavings.",
        "Style": "Eye-level medium close-up, 9:16 vertical ratio. Soft, natural lighting. Earthy color palette. Rapid cutting sequence to create a visual rhythm.",
        "Sounds": "Crisp, dry 'snaps' and 'pops.' The sound of wax shavings falling onto the wood with a soft 'patter.'",

    "scenario5": {
        "Subject": "A bunch of deep purple 'kinetic sand' grapes. Each grape is a perfect sphere held together by a thin, flexible plastic membrane.",
        "Action": "A pair of sharp titanium scissors snips individual grapes off the vine. Each snip causes the grape to burst, releasing the textured purple sand inside which holds its shape briefly before collapsing.",
        "Scene": "A clean, clinical white art studio. The background is completely white to make the purple color of the grapes pop intensely.",
        "Style": "9:16 vertical ratio. High-definition detail on the sand texture. Minimalist aesthetic. Center-weighted composition.",
        "Sounds": "The sharp 'snip' of metal scissors followed by a unique 'crunchy-soft' sound as the kinetic sand spills out.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No 16:9 horizontal aspect ratio, No silent moments, and No unrealistic scene transitions."

    "scenario6": {
        "Subject": "A chrome-plated dragonfruit. The outer 'scales' are metallic silver, while the inside is a stark white resin with tiny black obsidian-like seeds embedded within.",
        "Action": "A heavy industrial wire cutter snaps the fruit into quarters. The movement is powerful and swift. The 'metallic' skin peels back slightly at the edges of the cut.",
        "Scene": "An industrial workshop setting. A metal workbench with visible scratches and tools in the background. Cool, fluorescent overhead lighting.",
        "Style": "9:16 vertical ratio. Low-angle shot to make the fruit look imposing. Metallic reflections and sharp edges are emphasized.",
        "Sounds": "Deep, metallic 'booms' and the high-pitched 'twang' of a wire cutter. The sound of metal scraping against metal.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No 16:9 horizontal aspect ratio, No silent moments, and No unrealistic scene transitions."

    "scenario7": {
        "Subject": "A giant, oversized peach made of soft, velvet-flocked memory foam. It has a fuzzy texture and a deep orange-to-pink gradient color.",
        "Action": "An electric carving knife with dual moving blades slices into the peach. The foam compresses deeply under the blades before being sliced into perfectly uniform, airy layers.",
        "Scene": "A cozy, pastel-colored room. The peach sits on a ceramic white plate. Soft, diffused lighting creates a dream-like, 'Kawaii' aesthetic.",
        "Style": "9:16 vertical ratio. Close-up on the compression of the foam. Pastel color grading. High frame rate to capture the vibration of the electric blade.",
        "Sounds": "A low-frequency 'hum' from the motor, overlaid with a soft, airy 'shhh-zip' sound as the foam is sliced.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No 16:9 horizontal aspect ratio, No silent moments, and No unrealistic scene transitions."

    "scenario8": {
        "Subject": "A translucent blue 'ice' lemon. It looks like it is carved from a solid block of sapphire-colored ice, with visible internal bubbles and fractures.",
        "Action": "A heated knife (glowing red at the tip) melts through the lemon. Steam rises as the blade touches the 'ice' material. The knife slides through with zero resistance.",
        "Scene": "A dark, slate-grey stone surface. Wisps of dry ice vapor swirl around the base of the lemon for atmosphere. Mood lighting.",
        "Style": "9:16 vertical ratio. Focus on the steam and the glowing red blade. High contrast between the blue fruit and the orange glow of the knife.",
        "Sounds": "A loud, aggressive 'hiss' and 'sizzle' as the heat meets the cold material. The sound of water droplets hitting the hot metal.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No 16:9 horizontal aspect ratio, No silent moments, and No unrealistic scene transitions."

    "scenario9": {
        "Subject": "A segmented 'Rubik's' Orange. A toy orange made of 27 individual cubes held together by magnets. Each cube has a glossy orange-peel texture on the outside.",
        "Action": "A flat-edged spatula 'chops' through the magnetic seams. The cubes break apart in groups, clicking as the magnets detach and re-attach to the metal blade.",

        "Style": "9:16 vertical ratio. Fast-paced editing. Bright, pop-art color palette. Focus on the geometric alignment of the cubes.",
        "Sounds": "Satisfying magnetic 'clicks' and 'clacks.' A metallic 'tink' as the cubes hit the spatula.",
