        "Subject": "A bright red strawberry made of solid, clear ice. The seeds are painted on the outside. It is melting slightly, creating water droplets.",
        "Action": "A heavy metal meat cleaver strikes the ice strawberry. It doesn't slice cleanly but shatters the ice into geometric chunks and shards.",
        "Scene": "A backlit glass table. Blue and purple LED lights shine from underneath, making the ice glow.",
        "Style": "High-speed shutter to capture the shattering impact. Cyberpunk/Neon aesthetic. High contrast.",
        "Sounds": "A loud, sharp crack/shatter sound, followed by the tinkling of ice shards sliding across the glass table.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No captions, No silent moments, and No unrealistic scene transitions."
    },
    "scenario9": {
        "Subject": "A pineapple made of a yellow cellulose kitchen sponge. The leafy top is made of green scouring pad material.",
        "Action": "A serrated bread knife saws back and forth through the sponge pineapple. The sponge compresses and twists with the knife movement before being severed.",
        "Scene": "A stainless steel kitchen sink area. Water is lightly misted over the scene.",
        "Style": "Handheld, slightly shaky cam (POV style) to feel dynamic. Bright, clean, sterile lighting.",
        "Sounds": "Rough, scratchy sawing sounds (scritch-scratch), the sound of the sponge pores popping, and a final soft thud.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No captions, No silent moments, and No unrealistic scene transitions."

    "scenario10": {
        "Subject": "A bunch of purple grapes made of sticky, stretchy TPR (thermoplastic rubber). They are semi-translucent and look like gummy candy.",
        "Action": "A sharp razor blade slices a single grape. The rubber stretches elastically around the blade before finally snapping apart. The interior is sticky and clings to the blade.",
        "Scene": "A mirrored tray reflecting the grapes. The background is a solid white infinity wall.",
        "Style": "Macro zoom. Focus on the tension and elasticity of the material. Bright, commercial product lighting.",
        "Sounds": "A rubbery stretching sound, a sharp 'snap' when the material gives way, and a sticky peeling sound as the blade is removed.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No captions, No silent moments, and No unrealistic scene transitions."
