        "Subject": "A bunch of purple grapes made of sticky, stretchy TPR (thermoplastic rubber). They are semi-translucent and look like gummy candy.",
        "Action": "A sharp razor blade slices a single grape. The rubber stretches elastically around the blade before finally snapping apart. The interior is sticky and clings to the blade.",
        "Scene": "A mirrored tray reflecting the grapes. The background is a solid white infinity wall.",
        "Style": "Macro zoom. Focus on the tension and elasticity of the material. Bright, commercial product lighting.",
        "Sounds": "A rubbery stretching sound, a sharp 'snap' when the material gives way, and a sticky peeling sound as the blade is removed.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No captions, No silent moments, and No unrealistic scene transitions."
