    "scenario3": {
        "Subject": "A whole Dragon Fruit (Pitaya) made of dry, pink floral foam. The exterior has green leaf-like protrusions made of stiff paper. The texture is porous, dry, and brittle.",
        "Action": "A gloved hand holds the fruit steady while a sharp Japanese chef's knife slices horizontally through the center. The foam makes a clean break, but as the knife passes through, fine pink dust explodes into the air and crumbles onto the table.",
        "Scene": "A pitch-black studio void. The subject is illuminated by a single, strong spotlight from above (Rembrandt lighting), creating dramatic shadows and highlighting the dust particles floating in the air.",
        "Style": "Side profile eye-level shot. High contrast, cinematic look. 60fps frame rate. The focus tracks the knife blade as it moves through the medium.",
        "Sounds": "A loud, dry crunching sound similar to walking on dry leaves. The sound of the knife scraping against the gritty foam texture. The soft patter of foam crumbs hitting the surface.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No silent moments, No unrealistic actions, No unrealistic scene transitions, no overexposure, no ambient noise."
    },
    "scenario4": {
        "Subject": "A giant strawberry made of clear, solid ice with a frozen red dye core. The surface is frosted with condensation. Green leaves at the top are made of frozen mint.",
        "Action": "A heavy, rustic iron cleaver strikes the strawberry from above. instead of a clean slice, the ice shatters into chunky, crystal-like shards, revealing the red core which splashes slightly as it melts upon impact.",
        "Scene": "A dark slate stone surface. The background is a moody, blue-lit freezer environment with visible cold mist/fog rolling over the surface. The atmosphere is cold and industrial.",
        "Style": "45-degree angle close-up. Cold color temperature (blue hues). Sharp, crisp visuals to emphasize the jagged edges of the shattered ice. High shutter speed to freeze the flying ice chips.",
        "Sounds": "A sharp, high-pitched crack like glass breaking. The heavy thud of the cleaver hitting the stone. The tinkling sound of ice shards scattering across the stone surface.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No silent moments, No unrealistic actions, No unrealistic scene transitions, no warm lighting, no soft focus."
    },
    "scenario5": {
        "Subject": "A peach model made of compressed, pastel-colored gym chalk (ASMR chalk). The exterior is a gradient of soft pink and orange with a matte, powdery finish.",
        "Action": "A wide paint scraper tool is dragged slowly across the surface of the peach, shaving off thin, curling layers of chalk. The layers curl up and then disintegrate into fine powder that falls satisfyingly.",
        "Scene": "An artist's cutting mat in a bright, pastel-themed studio. In the background, blurred jars of colored pencils and paintbrushes are visible. The lighting is soft and warm, mimicking a cozy afternoon.",
        "Style": "Extreme Close-Up (ECU) focusing on the curling shaving. Pastel color palette with low contrast (dreamy look). Soft bokeh in the background.",
        "Sounds": "A scratchy, rasping sound of the scraper against the chalk. The soft, dusty sound of the powder landing. A continuous, rhythmic scraping noise that induces tingles.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No silent moments, No unrealistic actions, No unrealistic scene transitions, no harsh shadows, no jarring movements."
