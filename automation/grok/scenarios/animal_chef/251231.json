        "Action": "The rabbit stands on a sturdy wooden stool to reach the counter. In a continuous 6-second shot, it uses both front paws to rhythmically knead a small ball of dough. The rabbit pauses to pick up a small wooden rolling pin and rolls it forward once over the dough with focused determination.",
        "Scene": "A rustic, sunlit cottage kitchen with exposed wooden beams. A wooden countertop covered in scattered flour, a ceramic bowl of eggs, and a jar of sugar. Sunlight streams through a window with lace curtains, illuminating the floating flour dust particles.",

        "Action": "The otter stands at a low prep table. Over 6 seconds, it carefully places a slice of bright orange salmon onto a small mound of white rice. It then uses its front paws to gently press the fish onto the rice, shaping the nigiri with professional precision, then looks up at the camera.",
        "Scene": "A minimalist, high-end sushi bar setting. A smooth cypress wood counter, a bamboo rolling mat, a small dish of soy sauce, and a vase with a single cherry blossom branch in the background. Soft, cool interior lighting.",

        "Action": "The puppy is standing on its hind legs, front paws resting on the edge of a stove (safely). Over the 6 seconds, the puppy moves its head to stir a large silver pot of pasta sauce with the spoon in a circular motion. Steam rises from the pot as the puppy watches the food intently.",

    "scenario4": {
        "Subject": "A chubby North American Raccoon with distinct black mask markings, wearing a denim BBQ apron that is slightly too big. It is holding a metal spatula.",
        "Action": "The raccoon stands safely on a log next to a small charcoal grill. In the 6-second clip, it deftly slides the spatula under a vegetable skewer and flips it over. Sparks fly gently from the charcoal as the food hits the grate.",
        "Scene": "An outdoor campsite in a pine forest during twilight. A small portable charcoal grill glowing with heat. Background shows pine trees, a tent, and fireflies starting to appear. Smoky atmosphere.",
