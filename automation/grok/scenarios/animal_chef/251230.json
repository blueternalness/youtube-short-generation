        "Subject": "A round Giant Panda sitting comfortably, wearing a simple white chef's coat. It is holding a large metal wok handle.",
        "Action": "The panda skillfully tosses vegetables (broccoli, carrots, peppers) in the wok over a gas flame. The vegetables fly up into the air and land back in the pan. Steam rises from the hot food.",
        "Scene": "A professional kitchen station with stainless steel equipment. In the background, there is a blurred view of a busy kitchen environment with hanging pots and pans. Steam and smoke create an atmospheric effect.",
        "Style": "Action shot, slightly low angle looking up at the wok to catch the toss. High shutter speed look to freeze the vegetables in mid-air. Dramatic kitchen lighting with steam highlights.",
        "Sounds": "Sizzling oil, clanging of metal wok against the burner, whoosh sound of the vegetables being tossed, fire roaring.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No captions, No unrealistic scenes, No unrealistic scene transitions, no defying gravity, no extra limbs."

        "Action": "The hamster holds a miniature spatula and flips a tiny, coin-sized pancake on a griddle. The pancake flips over, revealing a golden-brown cooked side. The hamster watches it intently.",
        "Scene": "A macro-scale miniature kitchen set. Giant-looking (normal size) blueberries and a bottle of maple syrup are visible in the background, emphasizing the small scale of the hamster.",
        "Style": "Macro photography style, extreme close-up. Shallow depth of field where the background is very blurry. Bright, soft, diffused lighting to make it look like a commercial.",
        "Sounds": "Sizzle of batter, tiny metal clink of the spatula, soft sniffing sounds.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No captions, No unrealistic scenes, No unrealistic scene transitions, no blurriness on subject, no distorted face."
