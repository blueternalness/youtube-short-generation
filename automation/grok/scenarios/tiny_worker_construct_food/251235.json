    "scenario1": {
        "Subject": "A team of 1:87 scale miniature construction workers wearing neon yellow safety vests and white hard hats. A colossal, juicy beef patty topped with melting cheddar cheese. A bright yellow miniature mobile crane truck.",
        "Action": "In a continuous 6-second shot, the crane's cable lowers a massive crinkle-cut pickle slice onto the melted cheese. Two tiny ground workers hold guide ropes attached to the pickle, signaling the crane operator to lower it slowly. The pickle lands softly with a slight bounce.",
        "Scene": "A rustic wooden butcher block surface acting as the construction site. Background features a blurry kitchen counter with a ketchup bottle towering like a skyscraper. Warm, golden hour sunlight streaming from the left side, highlighting the texture of the meat and the grease on the cheese.",
        "Style": "Macro cinematography, 50mm lens, low angle looking up at the burger to emphasize scale. Shallow depth of field with focus sharp on the workers and the descending pickle. Realistic lighting, cinematic 4k resolution.",
        "Sounds": "Hydraulic whirring of the crane, heavy thud of the pickle landing, muffled shouting of workers giving directions ('Lower it, steady!'), ambient kitchen hum.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No captions, No unrealistic scenes, No unrealistic scene transitions, no cartoon physics, no text overlays, no morphing objects."

    "scenario2": {
        "Subject": "A road paving crew of tiny figures in orange jumpsuits. A giant, pink-frosted donut. A miniature steamroller and a miniature asphalt paver machine.",
        "Action": "The asphalt paver moves slowly across the curve of the donut, laying down a thick, smooth layer of bright pink strawberry frosting instead of asphalt. Following immediately behind, the steamroller flattens a few large, colorful sprinkles into the frosting. The workers rake the edges of the frosting to smooth it out.",
        "Scene": "Set on a white ceramic plate that looks like a vast white plaza. Soft, diffused bakery lighting (high key). In the background, a coffee mug rises like a silo. No steam or smoke, just clean construction.",
        "Style": "High-angle tilt-shift shot to emphasize the miniature effect. Slow, smooth camera tracking following the paver from left to right. Bright pastel color palette. Hyper-realistic texture on the frosting.",
        "Sounds": "Rumble of the heavy diesel engine of the paver, squishing sound of frosting being spread, scraping of rakes, beep-beep-beep of a vehicle reversing.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No captions, No unrealistic scenes, No unrealistic scene transitions, no floating objects, no glitch effects, no blurry motion."

    "scenario3": {
        "Subject": "Heavy machinery operators and tiny surveyors. A massive California Roll sushi piece. A miniature yellow bulldozer and a dump truck.",
        "Action": "A dump truck backs up and tilts its bed, pouring a load of sticky white sushi rice onto a dark green Nori sheet. A bulldozer immediately pushes the pile of rice, spreading it flat. A tiny surveyor with a theodolite measures the height of the rice layer.",
        "Scene": "The ground is a textured bamboo sushi rolling mat. The lighting is cool and crisp, mimicking a high-end sushi restaurant. Background is dark and out of focus, emphasizing the white rice and yellow machinery.",
        "Style": "Close-up side profile shot at ground level. The camera pans slightly to follow the bulldozer pushing the rice. Sharp focus on the texture of the sticky rice grains. High contrast lighting.",
        "Sounds": "Heavy engine idling, the sound of the truck bed lifting, the wet squelching sound of sticky rice being pushed, heavy gravel-like sound of rice falling from the truck.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No captions, No unrealistic scenes, No unrealistic scene transitions, no impossible geometry, no rapid cuts, no distorted machinery."

    "scenario4": {
        "Subject": "A team of lumberjacks and forestry workers with chainsaws. A towering stack of fluffy buttermilk pancakes. Miniature climbing gear and ropes.",
        "Action": "Workers are rappelling down the side of the pancake stack like it is a cliff face. One worker uses a caulking gun to inject maple syrup into a gap between pancakes. Another worker stands on top, sawing a pat of butter with a two-man saw.",
        "Scene": "A breakfast table setting with morning sunlight hitting the pancakes. A glass of orange juice in the background glows like a giant amber tank. Dust motes dancing in the light beams.",
        "Style": "Vertical camera movement (pedestal down) to show the scale of the stack. Macro lens capturing the porosity of the pancakes. Warm, morning light color grading. Realistic physics for the syrup viscosity.",
        "Sounds": "Buzzing of a tiny chainsaw, clinking of climbing carabiners, sticky sound of syrup oozing, distant morning birds chirping.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No captions, No unrealistic scenes, No unrealistic scene transitions, no flying humans, no magic spells, no oversized tools relative to workers."

    "scenario5": {
        "Subject": "Utility line workers and electricians. A giant bowl of spaghetti with meatballs. A miniature winch and cable system.",
        "Action": "A group of workers heaves on a rope connected to a winch, pulling a single, heavy strand of cooked spaghetti taut like a thick internet cable. They are guiding it to wrap around a massive meatball. Another worker secures the pasta with a large industrial clamp.",
        "Scene": "Inside a large white porcelain bowl. The curved white walls of the bowl act as the horizon. Ambient restaurant lighting with warm tungsten bulbs reflecting off the tomato sauce.",
        "Style": "Over-the-shoulder shot from behind the workers pulling the rope. dynamic tension in the visual composition. rich reds and yellows. Focus on the strain of the workers and the elasticity of the pasta.",
        "Sounds": "Creaking of the winch, rhythmic chanting of workers ('Heave! Heave!'), wet slaping sound of pasta moving, clanking of metal tools against the porcelain bowl.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No captions, No unrealistic scenes, No unrealistic scene transitions, no grotesque food, no messy composition, no unstable camera work."
