    "scenario9": {
        "Subject": "A cluster of grapes made of wax-covered balloons filled with cornstarch (stress ball texture). Purple exterior.",
        "Action": "A razor blade slices cleanly through one grape at a time. The wax coating snaps open, and the cornstarch inside holds the cut shape without spilling.",
        "Scene": "A mirrored surface reflecting the grapes. Dark purple mood lighting in the background.",
        "Style": "Extreme close-up, very shallow depth of field, moody aesthetic with reflections playing on the mirror.",
        "Sounds": "A distinct rubbery 'snap' as the balloon skin is cut, followed by a dry, powdery 'crunch' of the cornstarch separating.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No silent moments, and No unrealistic scene transitions."
    },
    "scenario10": {
        "Subject": "A giant strawberry made of layered playdough. Red outer layer, white inner layer, and a green playdough stem.",
        "Action": "A plastic roller cutter is pushed forcefully through the strawberry, flattening and cutting it simultaneously. The colors smear slightly at the edges.",
        "Scene": "A bright yellow plastic cutting board. The background is a blurred playroom shelf filled with colorful toys.",
        "Style": "High angle, saturated primary colors, playful and bright aesthetic, flat lighting.",
        "Sounds": "A dull, thick squishing noise, the sound of the plastic roller squeaking, and the suction sound of dough lifting off the board.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No silent moments, and No unrealistic scene transitions."
