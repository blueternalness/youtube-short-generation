        "Subject": "A dragon fruit model made of brittle, frozen white chalk with black sesame seeds embedded inside. The outer skin is a hardened pink plaster shell with green scales.",
        "Action": "A heavy, rusted iron cleaver strikes the fruit with force. The chalk shatters instantly upon impact rather than slicing cleanly. Shards of white chalk and pink shell explode outward in a radial pattern.",
        "Scene": "A dark, industrial concrete floor. Dramatic rim lighting from the side (chiaroscuro effect) highlights the debris field. A faint haze or smoke hangs in the air.",
        "Style": "Low angle, looking slightly up at the fruit. High shutter speed to freeze the shattering debris. Cool, desaturated color grading with a spotlight on the pink fruit.",
        "Sounds": "A loud, sharp 'crack' like breaking ceramic. The clattering sound of hard chalk pieces scattering across the concrete floor. Echoey, industrial ambiance.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No silent moments, No unrealistic actions, No unrealistic scene transitions, no soft textures, no overexposure."
    },
    "scenario5": {
        "Subject": "A giant peach model made of soft, pastel pink and orange polymer clay. The texture is matte and velvety, resembling realistic peach fuzz. The inside is a solid, creamy orange clay.",
        "Action": "A thin, taut wire cheese slicer is pulled slowly through the center of the peach. The clay offers resistance, dragging slightly before creating a perfectly smooth, smear-free cross-section.",
        "Scene": "A pastel aesthetic art studio. The surface is a rotating turntable covered in light blue velvet fabric. Softbox lighting creates a shadowless, dreamy atmosphere.",
        "Style": "Extreme close-up (macro) tracking shot that follows the wire moving through the clay. Pastel color palette (Wes Anderson style). Soft focus background.",
        "Sounds": "Low-frequency hum of the turntable. A deep, satisfying 'thrumming' sound as the wire cuts through the dense clay. A soft separation sound as the halves part.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No silent moments, No unrealistic actions, No unrealistic scene transitions, no sudden cuts, no jarring noises."
