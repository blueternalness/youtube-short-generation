    "scenario1": {
        "Subject": "A hyper-realistic watermelon slice model made entirely of vibrant pink and green kinetic sand. The texture is granular yet cohesive, holding a perfect shape until touched. The 'rind' is a layer of dark green sand, and the 'flesh' is bright pink with small black stone 'seeds'.",
        "Action": "A shiny, sharp silver chef's knife slowly slices vertically through the center of the sand watermelon. As the blade descends, the sand holds firm for a split second before satisfyingly crumbling apart. The two halves separate, and the sand flows slightly like a slow avalanche, revealing the grainy internal texture.",
        "Scene": "A rustic wooden picnic table outdoors under bright, natural sunlight. In the background, out of focus, is soft green grass and dappled sunlight filtering through leaves. The lighting is warm and high-contrast to highlight the grain of the sand.",
        "Style": "Macro close-up shot, 4k resolution, shallow depth of field focusing strictly on the blade and the sand. Slow-motion capture (60fps) to emphasize the physics of the falling sand particles.",
        "Sounds": "Loud, distinct gritty sound of metal sliding against sand (shhh-krr), followed by the soft, rushing sound of the sand crumbling and hitting the wooden table. No background music, pure ASMR.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No silent moments, No unrealistic actions, and No unrealistic scene transitions."

    "scenario2": {
        "Subject": "A translucent, cube-shaped model resembling a lime, made of clear green glycerin soap. The soap is perfectly smooth, glossy, and captures light like a gemstone. Inside the soap are suspended realistic lime zest particles.",
        "Action": "A heated knife with a glowing red edge is pressed gently onto the top of the soap lime. The knife melts through the soap like butter, sliding down effortlessly without resistance. As it cuts, thin curls of melted soap peel away from the cut line, and the block splits cleanly into two glassy halves.",
        "Scene": "A sleek, black marble countertop in a modern, minimalist bathroom setting. Cold, white studio lighting reflects off the wet, glossy surface of the soap. The background is a dark gray gradient.",
        "Style": "45-degree isometric angle, sharp focus, high contrast. The visual aesthetic is 'clean' and 'clinical'. Lighting highlights the transparency of the soap.",
        "Sounds": "A distinct sizzling hiss as the hot knife touches the soap, followed by a smooth, wet slicing sound. The sound of the two heavy soap halves falling onto the marble with a dull, solid thud.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No silent moments, No unrealistic actions, and No unrealistic scene transitions."
    },
    "scenario3": {
        "Subject": "A realistic pear model crafted from dry, crunchy gym chalk (magnesium carbonate). The exterior is dusted with a soft yellow and green pastel powder to mimic pear skin, but the texture is clearly dry and powdery.",
        "Action": "A heavy metal cleaver is brought down with force onto the chalk pear. Instead of a clean slice, the chalk shatters and crumbles into satisfying chunks and fine white dust. The blade grinds against the chalk as it hits the cutting board.",
        "Scene": "An industrial-style concrete table. The background features blurred metal shelving and dim, moody lighting. A single spotlight illuminates the chalk pear from above to dramatize the dust cloud.",
        "Style": "Front-facing eye-level shot. High shutter speed to capture the explosion of dust particles without motion blur. Cool color palette with desaturated tones.",
        "Sounds": "An intense, dry crunching snap (snap-crackle), the sound of the blade hitting the board, and the subtle airy 'poof' of fine dust settling.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No silent moments, No unrealistic actions, and No unrealistic scene transitions."

    "scenario4": {
        "Subject": "A giant strawberry model made of wet, green floral foam. It is painted red on the outside with acrylic paint, with small indentations for seeds, but the inside reveals the signature dark green foam texture.",
        "Action": "A human hand wearing a black latex glove slowly crushes the top of the strawberry model. Fingers press deep into the foam, leaving permanent indentations. Then, a wire clay cutter is dragged horizontally through the foam, creating a smooth, wet surface that glistens.",
        "Scene": "A bright, white ceramic surface in a sunroom full of plants. The background is filled with blurred greenery and flowers. Natural, soft daylight fills the scene.",
        "Style": "Top-down (overhead) shot. Bright and airy aesthetic. Soft focus on the background, razor-sharp focus on the crushing action. High saturation to make the red paint pop against the green foam.",
        "Sounds": "The signature 'wet floral foam crunch'—a squishy, crisp sound similar to walking on fresh snow. The sound of the wire cutter singing slightly as it drags through the dense foam.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No silent moments, No unrealistic actions, and No unrealistic scene transitions."
    },
    "scenario5": {
        "Subject": "A peach model made of wobbly, soft agar jelly. The jelly is semi-opaque pink and orange, with a very wet, glistening surface. It shakes and jiggles with the slightest movement.",
        "Action": "A metal crinkle cutter (wavy knife) is pressed down firmly into the jelly peach. The jelly resists slightly, bulging out to the sides, before the knife cuts through, creating wavy slices. The slices wobble and slide off one another onto the surface.",
        "Scene": "A pastel blue cutting mat in a bright, playful kitchen studio. The background features jars of colorful candy and pastel kitchenware. The lighting is softbox studio lighting, eliminating harsh shadows.",
        "Style": "Side profile close-up shot. Vibrant, candy-colored palette. 60fps video played back at regular speed to show the jiggle physics of the jelly.",
        "Sounds": "Sticky, wet mouth-watering squishing sounds. A suction 'pop' sound as the knife is lifted from the jelly, and the wet slap of the slices hitting the mat.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No silent moments, No unrealistic actions, and No unrealistic scene transitions."
