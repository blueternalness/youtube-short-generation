        "Subject": "A pineapple model made of water-saturated green floral foam. The exterior simulates the spiked texture of a pineapple, while the interior is a dense, wet, sponge-like foam.",
        "Action": "A hand wearing a latex glove squeezes the floral foam pineapple hard. Fingers sink deep into the foam, crushing the structure. Water oozes out rapidly, and the foam retains the shape of the crushed fingers.",
        "Scene": "A flat stone slab in a garden setting, surrounded by large tropical monstera leaves. Natural, overcast daylight provides even illumination without harsh shadows.",
        "Style": "Hand-held camera with subtle shake to emphasize the force of crushing. High definition, deep depth of field to show the water droplets and foam texture clearly.",
        "Sounds": "A satisfying wet crunching noise (floral foam crush). The sound of water dripping and squishing as the foam is compressed.",
        "Technical(Negative Prompt)": "No silent moments, No unrealistic actions, and No unrealistic scene transitions."
