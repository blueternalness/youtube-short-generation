        "Subject": "A fluffy Golden Retriever dog wearing a red plaid flannel shirt. The dog has a gentle expression and is sitting upright in a human-like posture at a wooden table. In front of the dog is a large, juicy cheeseburger with fresh lettuce and a sesame seed bun.",
        "Action": "The dog holds the burger steady with both front paws acting as hands. Over the course of 6 seconds, the dog opens its mouth wide and takes a large, satisfying bite of the burger, chewing enthusiastically with eyes closing in delight. No morphing or flying objects.",
        "Scene": "A cozy, rustic American diner setting. Warm ambient lighting from a hanging pendant lamp. A window in the background shows a rainy afternoon. The table has a napkin holder and ketchup bottle.",

        "Sounds": "Distinct sounds of the bun handling, a soft squishing sound of the burger being squeezed, a loud, wet biting sound, followed by rhythmic, heavy chewing and a satisfied exhale.",

        "Action": "The hamster sits on its hind legs on a tiny plate. It uses its small front paws to feed the spaghetti noodle into its mouth rapidly. As it chews, its cheeks puff out slightly. The action ends with a final slurp of the noodle tail.",
        "Scene": "A miniature Italian restaurant setup. A red and white checkered tablecloth. In the background, there is a blurry view of a candle and a tiny vase with a flower. Warm, romantic candlelight atmosphere.",

        "Sounds": "High-pitched, rapid nibbling sounds (nibble-nibble-nibble), a comical 'slurp' sound as the noodle disappears, and tiny lip-smacking noises.",

        "Style": "Medium close-up shot from a high angle looking down. Bright, high-key lighting, vivid saturation emphasizing the red of the watermelon against the brown fur.",
        "Sounds": "Loud, crisp crunching sounds of fresh fruit, the sound of watery juice squishing, and faint seagull sounds in the distant background.",

        "Scene": "A modern, bright kitchen with white marble countertops. Morning sunlight streams through a window, illuminating floating dust particles. A mug of coffee is visible in the background.",
        "Style": "Side profile shot shifting to a 45-degree angle. Soft, diffused morning light (golden hour). airy and clean aesthetic. Focus on the texture of the pancake and the cat's fur.",
        "Sounds": "Soft, sticky sounds of the pancake texture, gentle chewing, a low, rumbling purr that underlies the eating sounds to show contentment.",
